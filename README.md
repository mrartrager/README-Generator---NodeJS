  ## Description
  For this assingment we had to generate a README file using javascript and node. This is just the project readme file and not the one used to show how the program works. However I did use the program to make this readme as well.  

  ## Installation 
  Make sure to have node js installed and use inquirer version 8.2.4

  ## Usage 
  Here is a link to a video of me demonstrating how to use this program:
